Milestone 2
===

1. Did any of your answers to Milestone 1 change (particularly the Additional Questions, your idea for your site, or team members)? Write the numbers for the questions whose answers have changed, and their new answers.

    __We do not have significant changes to Milestone 1.__

2. Which features are implemented. To what extent are they complete?

    __We have implemented login, path generation, path saving, display of saved paths, location tags, and specifying the distance of tags. These features are usable, although the UI may be subject to change.__

3. Are there any features you wanted to include in your MVP from Milestone 1 that are not complete? If so, which are they?

    __No, we have implemented our desired features.__

4. What additional features do you wish to implement? How far along on those features are you?

    __We want to implement preset themes for paths that contain a selection of curated tags. We are curating the tags. We would like to implement a tutorial, which we haven't started yet.__

5. What technologies are you using for the back-end? Include any frameworks if relevant.

    __We are using a Django server.__

6. What technologies are you using for the front-end? Include Javascript frameworks such as jQuery, templating frameworks such as Handlebars.js, and other client-side frameworks such as Ember.js or Backbone.js.

    __We are using jQuery, jQuery.ui, the Django templating language, and several Javascript libraries such as jquery.form.js.__
7. What is the main browser you are targeting? Must be one of our supported browsers.

    __We are targeting Chrome.__
8. What implementation unknown / risks are you still facing? Consider this an exercise of imagination, not a test of confidence.

    __Because of the nature of our app, it is possible that the user picks tags that have no locations in the surrounding area. Currently, we don't have any measure of the "pleasantness" of our walking path, which could limit usability. We have the risk of Heroku downtime during judging, the UI could break, we could run out of Google API calls.__

9. If you are currently in the Rookie Division and would like to switch to the main competition, please let us know.

	__We would like to switch to the main division.__
